    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My name is Vo Tuan Anh and this is my project. Vocab Builder is a lightweight web application designed to help learners expand and retain vocabulary efficiently. You can create and manage custom word lists, practice with quizzes and flashcards, and track your progress over time. The front-end uses Vue and Vite for a responsive, fast user experience, while the server exposes a simple API for storing words, quiz results, and user progress. Whether you're studying for exams or learning a language casually, this app provides flexible study tools and clear progress indicators to help you stay motivated and improve steadily.</p>
